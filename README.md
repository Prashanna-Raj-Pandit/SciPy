# SciPy : Basics Computations

## Overview

SciPy is a powerful Python library built on NumPy, offering tools for scientific and technical computing. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed for Google Colab:
### What’s Covered

Basic Module
- Signal Processing: Techniques to smooth signals and detect peaks, with a focus on time-series analysis.
- Optimization: Finding function minima, demonstrated with a quadratic example.
- Integration: Numerical integration with visualization of areas under curves.
- Linear Algebra: Solving linear systems efficiently.
- Statistics: Basic statistical analysis with random data generation and hypothesis testing.
  
Advanced Module
- Interpolation: Advanced curve fitting for sparse or incomplete datasets.
- FFT: Frequency domain analysis for periodic signals.

To run these tutorials, you’ll need:
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
- **Environment**: Google Colab (recommended) or a local Jupyter setup.

### Installation (Local Setup)
If not using Colab, install dependencies via pip:
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
